## Simple CLI alarm script

What is purpose?
If you need to protect your Mac when you are in pablic place (caf√© etc) and you need to go away without device for a while (WC or whatever).
When charcger is disconnected, this script will turn volume on, set to 100% and turn off bluetooth (it's because of headphone usages, alarm in headphones it's useless).
You can use some app with GUI or this simple script.

### Required dependency

For bluetooth disconnection it's using blueutil, so need to be installed first
```
$ brew install blueutil
```

### Usage

Make `armed.sh` executable first.

```
 $ chmod a+x armed.sh
 // If you going to run alarm on background, you can use unarmed.sh as well
 $ chmod a+x unarmed.sh
```

And then just run it when you need protection.

```
$ ./armed.sh
```

Or you can run it as background job

```
$ ./armed.sh &
```

And when you need to kill it, just do

```
$ kill %$(jobs | grep "armed.sh" | grep -o "[0-9]")
```

Or you can use `unarmed.sh` which basically contains simillar command.

```
$ ./unarmed.sh
```
